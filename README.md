## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS

### What I learned

1. SCSS basics
2. 7-1 SCSS folder structure 
3. vanilla css variables vs SCSS variables 
- Vanilla css variables can have their value changed depending on different
  circumstances i.e. media queries. SCSS variables can't, as upon compiling
  they are replaced with their values.

### Useful resources
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a5j7KoflTs - taught me the very basics of SCSS, careful with the html in that video, the heading structure is not correct, using incorrect html practices like that can lead to accessibility and SEO problems.
